# Atomic Fox

GameDev.TV  Game Jam. Theme is Time

Atomic Fox is a single scene arcade 2D platformer. The game is set in a bioluminescent forest. Within the forest there exists the rare Caesium Flower which naturally expels the fuel (Caesium) that the protagonists require. But there’s a catch, the forest is full of Cardigans  - The Protectors of Caesium!

Our villainous character, Tick, is a fox from a far away land. Tick stole time from the Cardigans to stay young and now Tick has to get away, but in order to do so Tick must refuel. If Tick doesn’t get away, the poor fox will become old once again! Oh no! So help Tick avoid the Cardigans, collect fuel and escape time!

Wanted to make something using Unity, not very familiar with it (or game dev really). Learn't a lot about what to do and not to do... mainly the what not! There are  number of decisions that were probably a little unfortunate. Also, ran out of time to implement everything I had planned but there's a game loop! Had a great time putting it together.
